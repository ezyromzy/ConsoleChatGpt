Ensure you have an API key from OpenAI to access the GPT-3.5 model.
Replace "API-KEY" in the code with your actual API key.
Run the application in a C# environment.


Usage


The application prompts the user to input a message.
The message is sent to the OpenAI API for response generation.
The generated response is displayed in the console as if in a chat with "ChatGPT".


Code Structure


apiKey: Your OpenAI API key for authentication.
endPoint: The API endpoint for sending messages to the OpenAI GPT-3.5 model.
